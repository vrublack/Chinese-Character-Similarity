㬴;月,㇑,㇐,㇐,㇒

+ possibly weigh how common a component is






晨;日,辰

𣊭;日

+ repeat information (eg. 𣊭;日 4 times)

备

+ include simplified chinese <-> japanese mappings

坏;土,㇐,㇓,卜


环:a(王,不)
	王:d/t(㇐,土)

+ decompose further than radicals (maybe combine with position information)
+ include radical similarity table

㦼;㇐,㇐,㇑,㇒,彐,戈


+ maybe include positional information
(not much that can be done if one partial decomp is 田,㇑,㇐,㇐,㇒ and the other one 車)





刺;木,㇑,㇆,刂
制;牛,巾,刂

鞄;革,勹,尸,㇟

+ use idf weighting (as in tf-idf)

+ with cjk decomposition often stops soon. use wikipedia again?



cjkvi has many unencoded components and might be unsuitable for this task because they are any unencoded component with that stroke number, not a specific one:
Encircled numerics ① ～ ⑳ represents unencoded DCs. Number denotes its stroke count. This would be useful when calculating total strokes of ideographs. Such convention does not conform with the Annex I of ISO/IEC 10646, so please replace them with wildcard character `？' (U+FF1F) if you need a strict conformance with the UCS standard.

+ here the tolerance is too high so dissimilar components get matched. Algo with less splitting better here:

+ on the other hand, if the reference doesn't really share many strokes with the source, splitting into more components works better:
