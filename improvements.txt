+ with cjk decomposition often stops soon. use wikipedia again?



cjkvi has many unencoded components and might be unsuitable for this task because they are any unencoded component with that stroke number, not a specific one:
Encircled numerics ① ～ ⑳ represents unencoded DCs. Number denotes its stroke count. This would be useful when calculating total strokes of ideographs. Such convention does not conform with the Annex I of ISO/IEC 10646, so please replace them with wildcard character `？' (U+FF1F) if you need a strict conformance with the UCS standard.
